# Project 1: Code Refactor - Horiseon
## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the code for the Horiseon website to make it more accessible and allow the website to be optimized for search engines.

To acheive this goal I did a few things:

- I adjusted all the div tags to be semantic element tags. These tags include Main, Section, Aside, Figure, Article, etc.

- I adjsusted the selectors for the CSS to mirror the new semantic tags I added in the html.

- I consolidated the CSS to keep from repeating multiple lines of code to format the same sections that could be used with one semantic tag.

- I gave the webpage a more descriptive title.
